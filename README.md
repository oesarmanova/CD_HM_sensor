# 0.Experiment

We prepared aqueous suspensions of CDs with fixed concentration (8 mg/L) comprising heavy metal ions Cu<sup>2+</sup>, Ni<sup>2+</sup>, Cr<sup>3+</sup> with concentrations varying from 0 to 4.95 mM with 0.55 mM increment. For that pupose we added Cu(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> , Ni(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> , Cr(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub> salts to the CD-suspension in such quantities that Cu<sup>2+</sup>, Ni<sup>2+</sup>, Cr<sup>3+</sup> cations were present in the suspensions in desired concentrations.
Totally, 1000 suspensions were prepared.

We used Shimadzu RF-6000 spectrofluorimeter to register excitation-emission matrices (EEM) of CD's aqueous suspensions in the presence of heavy metal ions. Fluorescensce signal was excited under radiation with wavelengths ranging from 250 to 450 nm with 5 nm increment - that is 41 excitation wavelengths. Each fluorescence spectrum was registered in a range from 250 to 750 nm with 1 nm increment - that is 500 spectral channels.

# 1.Dataset

We registered 1000 EEMs corresponding to CD's aqueous suspensions with one, two and three cation types Cu<sup>2+</sup>, Ni<sup>2+</sup>, Cr<sup>3+</sup>.

The Figure above shows EEM. Up: CD suspension without cations. Down: CD suspension with three cations.

Each row in the matrix represents a fluorescence spectra at particular excitation wavlengths and comprises 500 spectral channels. Each column in the matrix represents excitation spectra registered in a particular spectral channel and comprises 41 channels. Thus, initial data represents 2D arrays of (41x500) size.

The dataset comprises 27 single-component suspensions (i.e. suspensions, containing 1 cation type), 240 double-component suspensions (containing 2 cation types), and 732 triple-component suspensions. One sample corresponds to the case when all the cations are not present in the suspension.

The dataset is present here https://github.com/oesarmanova/CD_HM_sensor/tree/main/CD_HM_dataset.
